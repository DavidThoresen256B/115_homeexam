I had some issues when trying to run the code with **"python3"** in Visual Studio Code. However, it worked perfectly fine using only **"python"** in the terminal: **python application.py**.

**Run server**|**Output**
-|-
python application.py|*Please specify either server (-s) or client (-c) mode*
python application.py -s|
python application.py -s -d 8|
python application.py -s -i 127.0.0.1 -p 8088|
python application.py -s -i 127.0.0.1 -p 8088 -d 8|

**Run client**|**Output**

python application.py -c|*Please specify file to transmit*
python application.py -c -i 127.0.0.1 -p 8088|*Please specify file to transmit*
